# FleetShift Podman Deployment

Deploy the full FleetShift stack using podman containers with compose.

---

> **macOS REQUIRED SETUP**
>
> Podman on macOS only forwards IPv6 loopback connections. You **must** add this
> entry to `/etc/hosts` or Keycloak will be unreachable from the browser and CLI:
>
> ```bash
> echo "::1 keycloak" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
> ```
>
>> This is a one-time setup. Without it, OIDC login, GUI access to Keycloak, and
> all authenticated CLI operations will hang.
>
> **Not needed on Linux** — port forwarding works on IPv4 there.

---

## Prerequisites

- **podman** installed and running (`podman --version`)
  - macOS: `podman machine init && podman machine start`
- **jq** installed (`jq --version`) — used for realm password generation
- **kind** installed (`kind --version`) — used for local cluster provisioning
- **`/etc/hosts` entry** on macOS (see above)
- Container images built or available (see [Building Dev Images](#building-dev-images))

## Quick Start

```bash
cd deploy/podman

# Start in demo mode (sqlite + local keycloak, the default)
make up

# Credentials are printed at the end of startup output.
# GUI: http://localhost:3000
# Keycloak: http://keycloak:8180 (requires /etc/hosts on macOS)
```

## Modes & Overrides

FleetShift uses named modes with per-axis overrides for flexible deployment configuration.

### Named Modes

| Mode | DB Backend | Auth Provider | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `demo` (default) | SQLite | Local Keycloak | Quick demos, local dev without external dependencies |
| `prod` | PostgreSQL | External OIDC | Production-like deployments |

```bash
make up                    # demo (default)
make up DEPLOY_MODE=prod       # prod
```

### Per-Axis Overrides

Override the DB backend or auth provider independently:

| Variable | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB` | `sqlite`, `postgres` | Database backend |
| `AUTH` | `local`, `external` | Auth provider (`local` = bundled Keycloak) |

```bash
make up DB=postgres AUTH=local       # postgres + local keycloak
make up DEPLOY_MODE=prod AUTH=local      # same as above (prod defaults to postgres)
make up DB=sqlite AUTH=external      # sqlite + external oidc
```

### Sticky Configuration

Set `DEPLOY_MODE` in `deploy/.env` to avoid passing it every time:

```bash
# deploy/.env
DEPLOY_MODE=prod
```

Command-line always takes precedence over `.env`.

## Dev Mode

`make dev` builds all container images from source and mounts source directories for hot-reload. This is the recommended way to develop the UI and backend together.

```bash
# From deploy/podman/ or the repo root:
make dev

# Equivalent to:
DEV=true make up
```

What it does:

- **Builds images from source** instead of pulling pre-built ones (`--build` is always passed)
- **fleetshift-server** — built from repo root Dockerfile, mounts Docker socket and `/tmp` for Kind cluster provisioning
- **fleetshift-gui** — built from the UI repo, hot-reloads on changes to `packages/gui/src/` and `packages/common/src/`
- **fleetshift-mock-servers** — built from the UI repo, runs `npm run dev` (nodemon) for live reload on `packages/mock-servers/src/` changes
- **fleetshift-mock-ui-plugins** — built from the UI repo (no source mounts; plugins are pre-built)

Requires `UI_DIR` in `.env` pointing to the `fleetshift-user-interface` repo (relative to `deploy/podman/`).

After changing Go code in the server, run `make rebuild` to rebuild the image and restart.

### Deployment Signing in Dev Mode

The dev stack uses OIDC-based signing by default: the user's signing public key is stored as a Keycloak user attribute and read from the ID token at deployment time. This avoids external dependencies (no GitHub key registry needed) and makes it easy to test the full sign → deploy → verify flow from the UI.

For signing from the UI to work, the OIDC client and audience must match the UI's Keycloak client:

```bash
# deploy/.env
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=fleetshift-ui
OIDC_AUDIENCE=fleetshift-ui
```

The `.env.template` defaults to `fleetshift-cli` which only works for CLI-based auth. Change both to `fleetshift-ui` when developing with the UI.

The key registry mode is controlled by these `.env` variables:

| Variable | Option A (OIDC claim) | Option B (GitHub) |
|---|---|---|
| `KEY_ENROLLMENT_CLIENT_ID` | `fleetshift-ui` | `fleetshift-signing` |
| `PUBLIC_KEY_CLAIM_EXPR` | `claims.signing_public_key` | _(unset)_ |
| `KEY_REGISTRY_ID` | _(unset)_ | `github.com` |
| `KEY_REGISTRY_SUBJECT_EXPR` | _(unset)_ | `claims.github_username` |

Option A (OIDC claim) is recommended for local dev. The `.env.template` defaults to Option B (GitHub) for shared environments.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make up` | Start the FleetShift stack. Accepts `DEPLOY_MODE=`, `DB=`, `AUTH=` overrides. |
| `make dev` | Start with local source builds + hot-reload (see [Dev Mode](#dev-mode)). |
| `make build` | Rebuild container images without restarting. |
| `make rebuild` | Stop, rebuild images, and restart in one shot. |
| `make down` | Stop all containers, preserve data volumes. |
| `make clean` | Stop all containers and remove ALL data (volumes, network, kind clusters). |
| `make status` | Show running containers and health status. |
| `make logs` | Tail logs from all containers. |
| `make logs-<service>` | Tail logs from one container (e.g., `make logs-fleetshift-server`). |
| `make restart-<service>` | Restart one container (e.g., `make restart-fleetshift-mock-servers`). |
| `make cli-setup` | Configure `fleetctl` CLI for local OIDC auth (requires running stack). |
| `make reset-keycloak` | Wipe Keycloak state, re-import realm with new passwords. |
| `make help` | Show all available targets. |

## Configuration

On first `make up`, the script copies `deploy/.env.template` to `deploy/.env`. Edit `.env` to customize. The `.env` file is gitignored.

Key settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_MODE` | `demo` | Named mode: `demo` or `prod` |
| `KC_HOSTNAME` | `keycloak` | Hostname Keycloak uses in all URLs (issuer, endpoints) |
| `KC_HTTP_PORT` | `8180` | Keycloak HTTP port |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `changeme` | PostgreSQL password (used when `DB=postgres`) |
| `FLEETSHIFT_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | Server log level |
| `UI_DIR` | `../../../fleetshift-user-interface` | Path to UI repo (relative to `deploy/podman/`, used by `make dev`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | `fleetshift-cli` | OIDC client ID for the auth method |
| `KEY_ENROLLMENT_CLIENT_ID` | `fleetshift-signing` | Client ID used during signer key enrollment |
| `PUBLIC_KEY_CLAIM_EXPR` | _(unset)_ | Token claim expression for OIDC-based key registry |
| `KEY_REGISTRY_ID` | `github.com` | External key registry ID (e.g., `github.com`) |
| `KEY_REGISTRY_SUBJECT_EXPR` | _(unset)_ | Token claim expression mapping to external registry subject |

### External OIDC (DEPLOY_MODE=prod)

When running in prod mode (`DEPLOY_MODE=prod` or `AUTH=external`), the stack connects to
an external OIDC provider instead of running a local Keycloak instance.

Required environment variables in `deploy/.env`:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | Full issuer URL (e.g., `https://keycloak.apps.cluster.example.com/realms/fleetshift`) |
| `OIDC_CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for the `ocp-console` confidential client |

The external OIDC provider must use publicly trusted TLS (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
Client IDs are fixed by the shared realm configuration and do not need to be set.

To deploy an external Keycloak instance, see `deploy/keycloak/README.md`.

### Dev User (optional)

Uncomment these in `.env` to auto-create a personal Keycloak user during startup (only applies when `AUTH=local`):

```bash
DEV_USER_USERNAME=mshort@redhat.com
DEV_USER_PASSWORD=mypassword
DEV_USER_GITHUB=mshort55
DEV_USER_ROLES=ops,dev
```

The user is created idempotently — re-running `make up` updates the existing user.

For ad-hoc user creation, use the script directly:

```bash
scripts/add-user.sh \
  --admin-password <admin password from make up output> \
  --username someone@redhat.com \
  --password theirpass \
  --github their-github \
  --roles ops,dev
```

### Image Overrides

By default, images come from `quay.io/stolostron/fleetshift-*:latest`. To use custom images, uncomment and set in `.env`:

```bash
FLEETSHIFT_SERVER_IMAGE=quay.io/mshort/fleetshift-server:latest
FLEETSHIFT_MOCK_SERVERS_IMAGE=quay.io/mshort/fleetshift-mock-servers:latest
FLEETSHIFT_MOCK_UI_PLUGINS_IMAGE=quay.io/mshort/fleetshift-mock-ui-plugins:latest
FLEETSHIFT_GUI_IMAGE=quay.io/mshort/fleetshift-gui:latest
```

## Building Dev Images

Images are built and pushed to your personal quay.io namespace. `DEV_REGISTRY` defaults to `quay.io/<your OS username>`.

```bash
# Server image (from fleetshift-poc repo root)
make image-build                              # tags as quay.io/$USER/fleetshift-server:latest
make image-build DEV_REGISTRY=quay.io/mshort  # override registry
make image-build IMAGE_TAG=0.2.0              # override tag
make image-push                               # push to registry

# UI images (from fleetshift-user-interface repo root)
make image-build-all    # builds all three UI images
make image-push         # pushes all three
```

After building, set the image overrides in `.env` and `make up`.

## CLI Setup

```bash
# Configure CLI auth (requires stack to be running)
make cli-setup

# Log in (opens browser for OIDC flow at http://keycloak:8180)
bin/fleetctl auth login

# Use it
bin/fleetctl --server localhost:50051 deployments list
```

## Attestation Test

Run the full end-to-end attestation flow (signing key enrollment, signed cluster deployment, signed ConfigMap delivery):

```bash
scripts/test-attestation.sh
```

This creates a dev user, logs in, enrolls a signing key, creates a signed kind cluster deployment, and deploys a signed ConfigMap to the managed cluster.

## Services

| Service | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GUI | http://localhost:3000 | FleetShift web interface |
| Mock API | http://localhost:4000 | Express middleware (auth, proxy, WebSocket) |
| FleetShift API | http://localhost:8085 | Go backend (HTTP gateway) |
| FleetShift gRPC | localhost:50051 | Go backend (gRPC, used by fleetctl) |
| Plugin assets | http://localhost:8001 | Module Federation plugin bundles |
| Keycloak (HTTP) | http://keycloak:8180 | OIDC provider (demo mode, requires /etc/hosts on macOS) |
| Keycloak (HTTPS) | https://keycloak:8443 | OIDC provider with TLS (demo mode) |

## Authentication

Passwords are generated on each `make up` (or `make reset-keycloak`) and printed to the console.

**Keycloak admin console** (`http://keycloak:8180/auth/admin`): `admin` / `<generated>`

**FleetShift realm users:**

| Username | Role | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ops` | ops | Operations persona — manages clusters |
| `dev` | dev | Developer persona — manages applications |

If `DEV_USER_*` is configured in `.env`, your personal user is also created.

## How Networking Works

All containers share a podman network called `fleetshift`. Containers resolve each other by service name via podman's built-in DNS (aardvark-dns).

`KC_HOSTNAME=keycloak` means Keycloak produces all URLs with the `keycloak` hostname. This works because:

- **Inside containers**: `keycloak` resolves to Keycloak's container IP via aardvark-dns
- **On the host (macOS)**: `keycloak` resolves to `::1` via `/etc/hosts`, and podman's gvproxy forwards IPv6 loopback connections to the VM
- **On the host (Linux)**: `keycloak` resolves to `127.0.0.1` via `/etc/hosts`, and port forwarding works directly

The `/etc/hosts` entry is only needed because the browser and CLI run on the host and need to reach Keycloak at the same hostname the server uses.

## Troubleshooting

### Keycloak unreachable from browser or CLI (macOS)

```bash
# Symptom: curl http://keycloak:8180/... hangs, but curl http://localhost:8180/... works
# Cause: missing /etc/hosts entry for IPv6 loopback
echo "::1 keycloak" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Verify:
curl -s http://keycloak:8180/auth/realms/master | head -c 50
```

### Container won't start

```bash
make logs-<service>

# Common issues:
# - Port already in use: stop whatever is using the port, or change in .env
# - Image not found: build it first (see "Building Dev Images")
```

### Keycloak crash loop

```bash
make logs-keycloak

# Common causes:
# - Invalid realm JSON (check deploy/keycloak/fleetshift-realm.json)
# - TLS cert permissions (make clean fixes this)
```

### GUI shows blank white screen

Check the browser DevTools Console and Network tab. Common causes:

- OIDC discovery request pending/failed — Keycloak may still be starting. Wait 30-60 seconds.
- OIDC authority URL wrong — the GUI image must be built with `authority: "http://keycloak:8180/..."` in oidcConfig.ts. Rebuild the GUI image if needed.
- API requests failing — check `make logs-fleetshift-mock-servers`

### FleetShift server keeps restarting

```bash
make logs-fleetshift-server

# Common causes:
# - "OIDC CA file not found" — keycloak-certs init container hasn't finished yet.
#   Usually resolves after a few restarts. If persistent: make clean && make up
```

### Podman socket issues

The podman socket path is auto-detected by `start.sh`. If cluster provisioning fails:

```bash
# Check your socket path
podman info --format '{{.Host.RemoteSocket.Path}}'

# If auto-detection fails, set it manually in .env:
# PODMAN_SOCKET=/path/to/podman.sock
```

### Stale Keycloak state

If realm changes aren't taking effect:

```bash
make reset-keycloak
make up
```

This wipes the Keycloak database and TLS certs, re-imports the realm, and generates new passwords.
