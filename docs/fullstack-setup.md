# Full-stack local development (Docker Compose)

One command starts the full stack: Keycloak, FleetShift server, mock API server,
mock UI plugins, and the GUI webpack dev server. Auth is bootstrapped
automatically — no manual steps needed.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2
- Add `keycloak` to your hosts file so the browser can reach it:
  ```bash
  # macOS / Linux
  echo '127.0.0.1 keycloak' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
  ```
- Clone [fleetshift-user-interface](https://github.com/fleetshift/fleetshift-user-interface) next to this repo and set `UI_DIR` in `.env` (default: `../fleetshift-user-interface`)

## Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service        | URL                          | Credentials   |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| GUI            | http://localhost:3000         |               |
| Mock API       | http://localhost:4000         |               |
| Mock plugins   | http://localhost:8001         |               |
| FleetShift API | http://localhost:8085         |               |
| gRPC           | localhost:50051              |               |
| Keycloak       | http://keycloak:8180         | admin / admin |

The browser accesses Keycloak via HTTP on port 8180. HTTPS (port 8443) is used
internally by kube-apiserver in kind clusters — the CA cert is auto-generated
and mounted automatically.

## Signing key enrollment

The UI includes a signing key management page. After logging in:

1. Navigate to the signing key page (Management plugin)
2. Click **Generate** to create an ECDSA P-256 key pair in the browser (IndexedDB)
3. Select a registry:
   - **Keycloak** — stores the public key as a Keycloak user attribute automatically
   - **GitHub** — copies the SSH public key to clipboard; paste it at github.com/settings/ssh/new as a **Signing Key**
   - **Manual** — copy the key yourself
4. Click **Enroll** to register the enrollment with the server

Once enrolled, creating deployments will sign them with your key. The server
verifies the signature using the public key from the selected registry.

For the GitHub registry, the user must have a `github_username` attribute set
in Keycloak (Admin Console → Users → Attributes) **before** logging in. See
[Key Registries](keycloak-key-registry.md) for details.

## Create a kind cluster

```bash
docker compose exec fleetshift fleetctl deployment create my-cluster \
  --target kind-local \
  --manifest '{"name":"my-cluster"}'
```

## View logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f fleetshift    # server logs
docker compose logs -f gui           # GUI webpack dev server
docker compose logs -f mock-servers  # mock API
```

## Tear down

```bash
docker compose down -v               # -v removes volumes (Keycloak data, certs)
```

## SQLite database

The FleetShift server stores data in `./data/fleetshift.db` (bind-mounted).
Delete `./data/` to reset state.

## Architecture: HTTP vs HTTPS Keycloak

Keycloak serves on two ports:

- **HTTP 8180** — used by the browser (GUI login) and the mock API server (JWT
  verification). Avoids TLS cert issues in the browser.
- **HTTPS 8443** — used by kube-apiserver in kind clusters (`--oidc-issuer-url`
  requires HTTPS). Self-signed CA cert is auto-generated and mounted into kind
  nodes via `--oidc-ca-file`.

The `OIDC_HTTPS_PORT` env var on the FleetShift server controls this: when set,
the kind agent rewrites `http://keycloak:8180/...` to `https://keycloak:8443/...`
before injecting it into the kubeadm config. Unset it to disable the rewrite
(cluster creation will fail with "URL scheme must be https").

## Environment variables

| Variable                          | Service    | Purpose |
|-----------------------------------|------------|---------|
| `UI_DIR`                          | compose    | Path to the fleetshift-user-interface repo |
| `CONTAINER_HOST`                  | fleetshift | Rewrite localhost OIDC URLs for containers (e.g. `keycloak`) |
| `OIDC_HTTPS_PORT`                | fleetshift | Upgrade HTTP OIDC URLs to HTTPS on this port (e.g. `8443`) |
| `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_DOCKER_NETWORK`| fleetshift | Docker network for kind clusters |
| `API_PROXY_TARGET`               | gui        | Backend URL for `/api` proxy |
| `KEYCLOAK_URL`                   | mock-servers | Keycloak base URL for JWKS |
| `MODE`                           | mock-servers | `live` for real K8s clusters, `mock` for seed data |

## Local development (without Docker)

### Build

```bash
task build:all      # builds bin/fleetshift and bin/fleetctl
```

### Run the server

```bash
./bin/fleetshift serve --http-addr :8085 --log-level debug
```

For kind cluster creation outside Docker, set `CONTAINER_HOST` and
`OIDC_HTTPS_PORT` so the OIDC issuer is reachable from kind containers:

```bash
CONTAINER_HOST=host.docker.internal \
OIDC_HTTPS_PORT=8443 \
./bin/fleetshift serve --http-addr :8085 --oidc-ca-file keycloak/certs/ca.crt --log-level debug
```

### Run tests

```bash
task test:all
```

### Generate protobuf code

```bash
task protogen       # requires buf CLI
```

## Keycloak realm

The realm config (`keycloak/fleetshift-realm.json`) bootstraps:

- **Realm**: `fleetshift`
- **Clients**: `fleetshift-ui` (public, browser), `fleetshift-cli` (public, device flow)
- **Users**: `ops` / `dev` / `admin` (password: `test`)
- **Roles**: `ops`, `dev`

### TLS certificates

Auto-generated on first `docker compose up` by the `keycloak-certs` init
container into a Docker volume. To access the Keycloak admin console
(`https://keycloak:8443`), accept the self-signed certificate warning in
your browser.
