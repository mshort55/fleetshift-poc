// TargetInfo describes a registered target. It is the full state the platform

// generation, and exposed via API. Properties are not used for placement;

// strategies and considered for invalidation.

// re-resolution when they change. Properties and other target metadata
// are excluded so they can change without triggering placement invalidation.
